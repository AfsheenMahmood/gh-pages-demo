## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. **Layout and Structure**
- The meal planner uses an HTML `<table>`-like layout created using **CSS Grid**.
- Each row represents a day of the week, and each column represents a meal type.
- Inside each grid cell is a meal item with a **custom-styled checkbox**.

### 2. **Checkboxes**
- Users can click checkboxes next to meal names to track what‚Äôs planned or done.
- These checkboxes are purely **client-side**, and state is not saved after refresh (but can be extended using localStorage).

### 3. **Grocery List**
- A `<textarea>` element is provided for users to manually type in grocery items.
- The list can be printed along with the meal plan.

### 4. **Print Support**
- The page is printable using your browser‚Äôs **Print** feature (`Ctrl + P` or `Cmd + P`).
- You can take a printed copy to the store or hang it on your fridge!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment (via GitHub Actions)

This project is deployed using [peaceiris/actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages), a popular GitHub Action to automate deployment to GitHub Pages.

### How it works:
- You push changes to the `main` branch
- GitHub Actions copies the files from the `src/` folder into a `public/` folder
- The `public/` folder is published to the `gh-pages` branch
- GitHub Pages uses the `gh-pages` branch to serve the site at your username.github.io

### Workflow Highlights:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
